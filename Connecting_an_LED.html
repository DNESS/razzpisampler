If they are connected directly to a voltage source (such as a GPIO output) that is greater than about 1.7 volts, they will draw a very large current. This can often be enough to either destroy the LED or whatever is providing the current—which is not good if your Raspberry Pi is providing the current.</p><p>You should always use a series resistor with an LED because the series resistor is placed <em>between</em> the LED and the voltage source, which limits the amount of current flowing through the LED to a level that is safe for both the LED and the GPIO pin driving it.</p><p>Raspberry Pi GPIO pins can only provide about 3 mA of current. LEDs will generally illuminate with any current greater than 1 mA, but will be brighter with more current. Use <a href="#table_9-1" data-type="xref"/> as a guide to selecting a series resistor based on the type of LED; the table also indicates the approximate current that will be drawn from the GPIO pin.</p><table id="table_9-1"><caption>Selecting series resistors for LEDs and a 3.3V GPIO pin</caption><thead><tr><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Red</p></td><td><p>470Ω</p></td><td><p>3.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Red</p></td><td><p>1kΩ</p></td><td><p>1.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Orange, yellow, green</p></td><td><p>470Ω</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Orange, yellow, green</p></td><td><p>1kΩ</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Blue, white</p></td><td><p>100Ω</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Blue, white</p></td><td><p>270Ω</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, in all cases, it is safe to use a 470Ω resistor. If you are using a blue or white LED, you can reduce the value of the series resistor considerably. If you want to play it safe, use 1kΩ.</p><p>If you wanted to extend the experiments that you made in the Python console into a program that makes the LED blink on and off repeatedly, you could paste the following code into the IDLE (<a href="#SEC5.2" data-type="xref"/>) or nano (<a href="#SEC3.6" data-type="xref"/>) editors. Save the file as <em>led_blink.py</em>. You can also download the program from the <a href="http://www.raspberrypicookbook.com"><em>Raspberry Pi Cookbook</em> website</a>.
