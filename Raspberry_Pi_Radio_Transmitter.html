The download even includes the theme from <em>Star Wars</em> to play as a sample.</p><p>All you need is a short length of wire attached to GPIO pin 4. A female-to-male header lead will work just fine for this. In fact, it should work with the radio right next to your Pi without any kind of antenna—such is the strength of the transmission.</p><figure id="FIG4.11" float="true"><figcaption>Raspberry Pi as an FM transmitter</figcaption><img src="images/rpck_0411.png"/></figure><p>The first step is to install the <em>pifm</em> library using the following commands:</p><pre data-type="programlisting">$ mkdir pifm
$ cd pifm
$ wget http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/images/c/c3/Pifm.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf Pifm.tar.gz</pre><p>Next, find yourself an FM radio receiver and tune it to 103.0 MHz. If this frequency is already occupied by some other transmission, pick another frequency and make note of it.</p><p>Now run the following command (changing the final parameter from 103.0 to a different frequency if you had to change frequency):</p><pre data-type="programlisting">sudo ./pifm sound.wav 103.0</pre><p>If all is well, you should hear the stirring tones of the <em>Star Wars</em> theme.</p></section><section id="_discussion_72" data-type="sect1"><h2>Discussion</h2><p>You need to know that this project may not be legal in your country. The power output is higher than that of FM transmitters used with MP3 players.</p><p>You can play other <em>.wav</em> files, but they must be 16-bit 44.1kHz mono.</p><p>The code also includes a Python library that you can use within your own Python programs. So, you could write yourself a user interface to allow the selection and playing of tunes.</p><p>The following fragment of code illustrates the use of the Python interface:</p><pre data-type="programlisting">pi@raspberrypi ~/pifm $ sudo python
