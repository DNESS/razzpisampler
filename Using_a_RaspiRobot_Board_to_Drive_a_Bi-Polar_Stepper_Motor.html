So in this case, the 12V power will be supplying both the 12V stepper motor and the Raspberry Pi.</p><div data-type="warning"><p>The Raspberry Pi should not be powered through its USB connection when the RaspiRobot board is also powered, or slight differences in the 5V from the Raspberry Pi USB and the 5V regulated supply from the RaspiRobot board could cause large currents to flow and damage either the board or the Raspberry Pi. Power one board or the other, but not both.</p></div><p>Connect the stepper motor and power supply to the RaspiRobot board as shown in <a href="#FIG7.100a" data-type="xref"/>.

As with all the program examples in this book, you can also download the program from the Code section of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypicookbook.com"><em>Raspberry Pi Cookbook</em> website</a>, where it is called <em>stepper_rrb.py</em>. This program uses the command line, so you can run it from SSH.</p><p>If youâ€™re using Python 3, change the command <code>raw_input</code> to just <code>input</code>:</p><pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="python">import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

This means that as well as changing the pin allocations, you also need to modify the step sequence to:</p><pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="python">forward_seq = ['1011', '1111', '1110', '1010']</pre><p>The first and third bit of each part of the sequence are always 1, enabling both motors. It is now only the second and fourth bits that control the polarity of each of the two stepper windings.</p></section><section id="_see_also_171" data-type="sect2"><h2>See Also</h2><p>You can find out more about the RaspiRobot board and other projects that use it at the <a href="http://www.raspirobot.com">RaspiRobot website</a>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_Mstep"/></p><p>To drive a stepper motor using a L293D on a breadboard, see <a href="#SEC7.21-5" data-type="xref"/>.</p></section></section>
